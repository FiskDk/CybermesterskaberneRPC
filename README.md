## How do you get the tokens?
Open the program once to generate the opt.txt file.

Go to the main website, and open DevTools (CTRL + Shift + I)
Then go to the Network tab and reload the page.
Find the request saying "solves" view the request info and find your cookie and CSRF token
Then put them into the opt.txt file (Found in the same dir as the exe)
